Covid-19 analysis using global dataset from 2020 to 2021

# Summary 

Covid-19 also known as (SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus) is viral respiratory disease first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since its discovery, it has spread across the globe, leading to the ongoing pandemic. The virus causes illness ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia.  and so far, there is over 273 million confirmed cases worldwide. The virus can be transmitted via droplets from infected person. The common prevention methods include wearing a mask and maintaining social distance in social gathering. 

The goal of this project is to build a classification and unsupervised learning model that examines the recovery rate of covid-19 and how it is impact by factors like confirmed cases, death, and country/region. Furthermore, linear discriminate analysis (LDA) was used for classification model, regression tree was utilized for tree-based analysis and finally hierarchical clustering using dendrogram supported in understanding clusters formations. 

The project analysis is designed to be presented for healthcare directors working in World Health Organization (WHO) and policy makers who are interested in acquiring knowledge on covid-19 recovery rate and working to avert next pandemic.
